    <p>
    ReShape is intended for interactive webpage "applications". It replaces key presses with other key presses (e.g. A replaced with Shift+S). It can also accompany the key press with a mouse click on an element (selected with a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">CSS selector</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    ReShape currently only supports pages using jQuery, listening to key down events for the whole page.
    <p>
    <b>The settings for ReShape are stored in your browser, for each webpage where you use it. By using ReShape you agree to this.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    ReShape is licensed under GPLv3+. It uses jQuery for grabbing key presses.

    <h2>Bookmarklet</h2>
    <p>
    Use the following bookmarklet to load ReShape using a bookmark.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="releases/">ReShape</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Userscript</h2>
    <p>
    Use the following userscript to automatically load ReShape. The script is tested with ViolentMonkey.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Warning! To know when the events of the webpage can be reconfigured, the userscript uses a simple polling mechanism, which is not guaranteed to work. reshapeInitWhenStable() can be tweaked for the webpage in question.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Click the following link to add the userscript. Update <i>@match</i> with the URL of the webpage where you want to use ReShape.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="release/.user.js">ReShape Userscript</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Live Example</h2>
    <p>
    The box below lists keys that have been pressed (try pressing a key!).
    </p>
    <p>
    Click the ReShape button (<span id="reshape-button"></span>) on the bottom right of the browser window and map a key (e.g. A to S) and then try pressing keys again.
    </p>
    <div id="keycode" style="height: 140px; width: 3em; padding: 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; background: #eee;">
      Press a key!
    </div>
    <h3>Mouse Click</h3>
    <p>
    To click the button using a key, add a key mapping with:
    <ul>
    <li> Listen: C
    <li> Send: .  (The button does not need a key, but one must currently be entered)
    <li> Click: input[my-name="clickbutton"]
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
    The Click value was found by inspecting the element using the built-in web browser inspector (Ctrl+Shift+I) and writing a matching <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">CSS selector</a>. Note that the element you want to click on must existing when the click is performed. The sent key can be used to bring up menus that contain elements to click.
    </p>
    <p>
    <input type="button" my-name="clickbutton" value="Click me!" onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">
    </p>
    <h3>Custom keycode</h3>
    <p>
    The keycode for a key, in Javascript, matches the button that is pressed, without any modifiers. For example, <pre>5</pre> and <pre>%</pre> is on the same key on many keyboard layouts. Both <pre>5</pre> (press <pre>5</pre>) and <pre>%</pre> (press <pre>shift</pre>+<pre>5</pre>) results in the same keycode (<pre><53></pre>).
    <p></p>
    The keycode becomes a problem when a keyboard layout has a character only as the shift option on a key, but a webpage expects a dedicated key for the given character to exist.
    <p></p>
    Example: Swedish QWERTY has <pre>?</pre> as <pre>shift</pre>+<pre>+</pre> (<pre>shift</pre>+<pre><171></pre>), while US QWERTY has <pre>?</pre> as <pre>shift</pre>+<pre>/</pre> (<pre>shift</pre>+<pre><191></pre>). The webpage expects <pre>shift</pre>+<pre><191></pre>, but the Swedish user will press <pre>shift</pre>+<pre><171></pre>.
    <p></p>
    In this case, the Swedish user cannot press <pre>/</pre> to map to <pre><191></pre>, because no such key exists in the Swedish layout (<pre>shift</pre>+<pre>7</pre> (<pre>shift</pre>+<pre><55></pre>) is used for <pre>/</pre>).
    <p></p>
    To solve the problem in ReShape, the user can either change to a US layout, and press the key, or right-click on the key button in ReShape and enter the code <pre>191</pre> manually. He also needs to enable <pre>shift</pre> by pressing the <pre>shift</pre> button in ReShape.
